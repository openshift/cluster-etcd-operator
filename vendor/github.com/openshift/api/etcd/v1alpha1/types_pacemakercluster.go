// # PacemakerCluster represents the current state of the Pacemaker cluster as reported by the pcs status command
//
// This resource provides a view into the health and status of a Pacemaker-managed cluster in dual-replica (two-node)
// deployments. The status is periodically collected by a privileged controller and made available for monitoring
// and health checking purposes.
//
// Design Principle: Act on Deterministic Information
// Almost all fields are optional and will be populated if the data is available. If a field is not populated, it means that
// no actions can be taken by the cluster-etcd-operator with regard to whether pacemaker is healthy. This means that the
// operator will only transition between the PacemakerHealthy and PacemakerDegraded states based on deterministic information. Otherwise,
// the last known PacemakerHealthy or PacemakerDegraded status will be preserved.
//
// Some examples actions taken on deterministic information would be:
// - If the cluster is known to have quorum and critical resources are started, the operator report PacemakerHealthy state.
// - If the cluster is known to have lost quorum, or one or more critical resources are not started, the operator report PacemakerDegraded state.
// - If the cluster is trying to replace a failed node, it will check to see if the replacement node matches the expected node configuration in
//   pacemaker before proceeding with node replacement operations.
