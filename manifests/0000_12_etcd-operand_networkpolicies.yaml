# NetworkPolicy for etcd operand pods in the openshift-etcd namespace.
#
# The etcd static pods use hostNetwork: true and bypass NetworkPolicy entirely.
# The guard, installer, and pruner pods run on the pod network and are subject to NetworkPolicy.
---
# Default-deny policy for the openshift-etcd namespace.
# This policy selects all pods in the namespace and enables default-deny for both
# ingress and egress by specifying policyTypes without any allow rules.
#
# NetworkPolicies are additive (use OR logic):
# - This policy enables default-deny for all pods
# - Subsequent policies add specific allow rules
# - If any policy allows traffic, that traffic is permitted
# - Policies cannot override or block traffic allowed by other policies
#
# Note: etcd static pods use hostNetwork: true and bypass all NetworkPolicy rules.
# This policy only affects pods running on the pod network (guard, installer, pruner).
