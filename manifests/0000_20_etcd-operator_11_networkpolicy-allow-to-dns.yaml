# Allow egress to DNS for the etcd-operator.
# The operator needs DNS resolution to resolve service names and API endpoints.
#
# This policy allows all pods in the namespace to access the DNS service
# running in the openshift-dns namespace.
#
# Note: This is the first NetworkPolicy for this namespace, so creating it
# automatically enables default-deny for both ingress and egress on all
# selected pods. No separate "default-deny" policy is needed.
