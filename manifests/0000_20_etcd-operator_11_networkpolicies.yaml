# Network Policies for cluster-etcd-operator
#
# These policies control network access for the etcd-operator pod in the
# openshift-etcd-operator namespace. Since this is a core component that
# controls its entire namespace, most policies use podSelector: {} to select
# all pods in the namespace.
#
# IMPORTANT: There is no separate "default-deny" policy. As soon as ANY
# NetworkPolicy selects a pod, that pod automatically gets implicit default-deny
# for both ingress and egress. The first policy below (allow-to-dns) creates
# this default-deny behavior for all pods in the namespace.
#
# Note: etcd pods run with hostNetwork: true and are NOT subject to these policies.
---
# Allow egress to DNS for the etcd-operator.
# The operator needs DNS resolution to resolve service names and API endpoints.
#
# This policy allows all pods in the namespace to access the DNS service
# running in the openshift-dns namespace.
#
# Note: This is the first NetworkPolicy for this namespace, so creating it
# automatically enables default-deny for both ingress and egress on all
# selected pods. No separate "default-deny" policy is needed.

# Allow egress to the Kubernetes API server.

# - Update cluster operator status
# - Watch nodes and other cluster resources

# Note: Only the operator pods need API access, not all pods in the namespace.
# However, since this is a core component that controls the entire namespace,
# we use podSelector: {} for simplicity.

# Allow ingress to the metrics endpoint from Prometheus.

# with the host-network policy group label to scrape metrics from the operator.

# Allow egress to etcd endpoints.
# The etcd-operator needs to communicate with etcd pods to:
# - Manage the etcd cluster (add/remove members)
# - Check etcd health and status
# - Perform backup and restore operations
#
# IMPORTANT: etcd pods run with hostNetwork: true, which means they bypass
# NetworkPolicy entirely. Since the operator needs to connect to etcd on the
# host network, we must allow egress to the etcd client port (2379) and
# metrics ports (9978, 9979) without destination restrictions.
#
# Note: We allow egress on these specific ports to any destination because:
# 1. etcd runs on the host network and is accessed via node IPs
# 2. NetworkPolicy cannot select host-networked pods
# 3. The operator discovers etcd endpoints dynamically via the API server
