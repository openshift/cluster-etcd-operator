# Default-deny policy for the openshift-etcd-operator namespace.
# This policy selects all pods in the namespace and enables default-deny for both
# ingress and egress by specifying policyTypes without any allow rules.
#
# NetworkPolicies are additive (use OR logic):
# - This policy enables default-deny for all pods
# - Subsequent policies add specific allow rules
# - If any policy allows traffic, that traffic is permitted
# - Policies cannot override or block traffic allowed by other policies
#
# Without this policy, all pods would have unrestricted network access (allow-all).
