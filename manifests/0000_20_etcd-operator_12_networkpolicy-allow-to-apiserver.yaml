# Allow egress to the Kubernetes API server.
# The etcd-operator needs to communicate with the API server to:
# - Watch and update etcd resources
# - Manage pods, services, and other resources in the openshift-etcd namespace
# - Update cluster operator status
# - Watch nodes and other cluster resources
#
# Note: Only the operator pods need API access, not all pods in the namespace.
# However, since this is a core component that controls the entire namespace,
# we use podSelector: {} for simplicity.
